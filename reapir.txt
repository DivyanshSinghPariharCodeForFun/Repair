### 🔥 To Remove Commvault Completely:

#### 1. **Stop all Commvault services**

```bash
/opt/commvault/Base/cvstop
```

#### 2. **Verify no Commvault processes are running**

```bash
ps aux | grep commvault
```

Should return only the `grep` line.

#### 3. **Delete Commvault directory**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/commvault
```

#### 4. (Optional) **Clean up leftover service files**

```bash
sudo find /etc/systemd /lib/systemd -name "*commvault*" -exec rm -f {} \;
```

Then update it. Leaving **libcurl.so v8.4.0** live = dumb risk.

Make a final call. Right now it’s dead weight and a potential exploit vector.
